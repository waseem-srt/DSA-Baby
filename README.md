There was a time when I **hated coding**.  
I’d see software engineers earning well, living their dreams, and I said to myself:  
*"I want to be one of them."*

I strongly believed in what Elvis Presley once said:  
> **"Ambition is a dream with a V8 engine."**

But as I stepped into this journey, I realized that **coding is much more than a skill for a job**, it’s a way to **solve real problems** in countless creative ways.  

For a **newbie**, coding can seem like a nightmare.  
But when you **equip yourself with the right mindset & tools**, it transforms into a **blissful journey of building, learning, and growing**.
